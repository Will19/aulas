A Property may represent an attribute of a Classifier, a memberEnd of an Association, or in some cases both
simultaneously

Sometimes a Property is used to model circumstances in which one instance is used to group together a set of instances; this is called aggregation

(agregação: todo-parte, dono)

Composite aggregation is a strong form of aggregation that requires a part object be included in at most one composite object at a time. If a composite object is deleted, all of its part instances that are objects are deleted with it

NOTE. A part object may (where otherwise allowed) be removed from a composite object before the composite object is deleted, and thus not be deleted as part of the composite object.
